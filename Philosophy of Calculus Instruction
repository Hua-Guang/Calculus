Philosophy of Calculus Instruction
The emphasis is on understanding concepts. I think that nearly everybody agrees that this should be the primary goal of calculus instruction. In fact, the impetus for the current calculus reform movement came from the Tulane Conference in 1986, which formulated as their first recommandation: Focus on conceptual understanding. I have tried to implement this goal through the Rule of Three: "Topics should be presented geometrically, numerically, and algebraically." Visualization, numerical and graphical experimentation, and other approaches have changed how we teach conceptual reasoning in fundamental ways. The Rule of Three has been expanded to become the Rule of Four by emphasizing the verbal, or descriptive, point of view as well.     ----Calculus, by James Stewart, ISBN 978-7-04-039620-1 (Page 6, Preface)
